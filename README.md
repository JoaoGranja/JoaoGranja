I am a software engineer who love developing clean, innovative and high quality solutions. 
I am a very versatile engineer who have worked with embedded systems (programming on microcontrollers) but also 
with distributed systems (Middleware, software applications). 
What pull me up are challenges and interesting projects where I need to analyse in detail about it and decide the best solution to solve it.
I love working on team, helping my colleagues finding solutions for their problems, and keep learning new stuffs (methodologies, technologies, languages)

In order to keep me up motivated and be ready to face future challenges, I usually read some papers and take some online courses. 
I will love keep working on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision projects.
