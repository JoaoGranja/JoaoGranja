I am a software engineer who loves developing intelligent, innovative and high quality solutions. 
I am a very versatile engineer who have worked with embedded systems (programming on microcontrollers) but also 
with system servers (Middleware, software applications). 
Right now, I’m the responsible for implementing the Automatic Departure Clearance functionality on the Lisbon Tower ATM system.


I stayed excited working on challenges and interesting projects where I love working on team, helping my colleagues finding solutions for their problems.
I am self-taught person with great motivation to taught myself trending technologies/tools (example, Machine Learning, Deep Learning).
